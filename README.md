Toxic Releases in the Petroleum Industry

The petroleum industry, despite accounting for a smaller fraction of the overall industrial releases, plays a disproportionately large role in contributing to environmental pollution. The types and volumes of chemicals released, notably Nitrate compounds and Ammonia, have far-reaching effects on air and water quality. The predominance of these releases in air and water indicates a significant risk not only to the environment but also to public health.

Objective:
Our main goal is to analyze and present the 2022 toxin release inventory for the US states , and Texas in particular. 
Our analysis, rooted in data analytics and visualization, highlights the crucial role that data plays in understanding and addressing environmental issues. Informed decision-making, driven by comprehensive data analysis, is essential for developing effective environmental policies and strategies.

Data exploration:
For the analysis, we used the following official website for the Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-present)
Please see the attached Excel spreadsheet, and our coding files where we have drilled downt the data according to the chemical type, location, and industry type.
