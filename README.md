Outline project ideas
Our main goal is to analyze and present the 2022 toxin release inventory for the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.

Perform an initial data exploration:
For the analysis, we used the following official website for the Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-present)

Begin research of datasets
Please see the attached Excel spreadsheet, where we have started filtering the data according to the chemical type, location, and industry type.
